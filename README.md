My Web Portfolio project

I used the below links to learn how to sync, commit, and push my vscode projects to github

My Webportfolio project was a very challenging task, because i was in severe pains for about 3 weeks, after i sprained my ankle. i had to work on it randomly to secure some marks and not get low grades.

At first i wanted to write all classes and customizations myself, i found some tutorials on bootstrap which i used to creat another version. of my portfolio

Somewhere after i have structured everything on the pages, the css stopped working for my index.html pages i tried troubleshing from all angles and i couldn't fix it. 

Than was when i started having a second though to use fully bootsrap. While trying to make the pages fully responsive, i found out that minmax(300px, 1fr) trick couldn't help me achieve alot of things and was messing up my whole pages.

I wrote the full grids with grid-areas for my home page.
I utilized the flex-box trick for my navigations.

----- THE DOOM ---------

After writing all these codes, i wanted to add the prefixes and make it work on all browsers, after i did that all my pages stopped working properly. some stopped loading the css. At this point i was fraustred and not able to get anything to work.

I remembered i pushed my progress to github in my URL (https://ezem0002.github.io/) i saved that part for submission incase i wasn't able to make any progress.


After all the trials, i found a way to some js plugins and bootstrap to achieve a little progress.
