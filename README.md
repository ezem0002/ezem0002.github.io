My Web Portfolio project

I used the below links to learn how to sync, commit, and push my vscode projects to github
<!-- https://help.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line -->

My Webportfolio project was a very challenging task, because i was in severe pains for about 3 weeks, after i sprained my ankle. i had to work on it randomly to secure some marks and not get low grades.

At first i wanted to write all classes and customizations myself without shortcuts, 

Somewhere after i have structured everything on the pages, the css stopped working for my index.html and portfolio page  i tried troubleshing from all angles and i couldn't fix it. I deleted the page and recreated it but still it couldnt work. i deleted the whole css and re-styled it and it didnt work either. At this point i was getting really fraustrated and didn't know who to go to as i cannot walk cos of the crouches and aircast i had on my leg. 

Thiss was when i started having a second thought to try bootsrap, but i had zero knowledge on how to use it.  jumped on youtube for two days and after then i had an idea on how to integrate bootstrap and achieve a seamless design.


Bootsrap became harder to use especially when i want to tweak to my own taste. i trashed all these ideas and started afresh writing my codes line by line, While trying to make the pages fully responsive, i found out that minmax(300px, 1fr) trick couldn't help me achieve alot of things and was messing up my whole pages.

I wrote the cards with grids.
I utilized flex-box too.

----- THE DOOM ---------

After writing all these codes, i wanted to add the prefixes and make it work on all browsers, after i did that all my pages stopped working properly for the third time. some pages stopped loading the css. At this point i was fraustred and not able to get anything to work. i gave up at this point and decided to jut submit what i could do as the deadline was hours away.

I remembered i pushed my progress to github in my URL (https://ezem0002.github.io/) i saved that part for submission incase i wasn't able to make any progress. but i didn't like that design and how i repreented my design.


After all the trials my initial job which is on github didn't load any more on my computer.
google and stackoverflow helped me alot during this period because i didnt even know i could get to this extent wrting my codes from scratch.
